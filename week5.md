# Week 5


 
 
 

### Takeaways
====================

 One takeaway I had was I really didn't do much learning. I mostly went over old code snippets I had done and tried mixing up those beats to make my remixes. Also I was talking to people who were doing earsketch and talking to them about some of the ways they created music, looking for inspiration.

### Challenges
====================

A challenge I had was coming up with inspiration for my final project. What I want to do is make a song with the piano notes it comes with but have my own remix to it. I looked up some music with piano notes to start off and also got some inspiration from Mr.Mueller on his songs he came out with. Check him out on spotify!!!
