# week 7

___

Project Time!
___
This week is going to be crunch time. I've been working on this little song for the past couple of days. The purpose of this song or what I want to do with it is put something soft and mello in the beginning and then remix it to have all sorts of beats and sounds afterwards.

### Takeaways
====================


### Challenges
====================

-One thing I've noticed that was difficult when making a project with Sonic Pi is that all of your synths and samples can't be previewed. This a big hastle with creating beats because you'd need to try out every single one of the example synths and samples to find out what they sound like.
