# week 7

Project Time!
___
This week is going to be crunch time. I've been working on this little song for the past couple of days. The purpose of this song or what I want to do with it is put something soft and mello in the beginning and then remix it to have all sorts of beats and sounds afterwards.

### Takeaways
====================
- A takeaway I have from working on this project is tinker, tinker, and tinker more. You are never going to know what you want exactly but just putting different sounds together can creat a song. Also I listened to more music to find out different riffs people use in their songs and try to manipulate it in Sonic Pi,

### Challenges
====================

-One thing I've noticed that was difficult when making a project with Sonic Pi is that all of your synths and samples can't be previewed. This a big hastle with creating beats because you'd need to try out every single one of the example synths and samples to find out what they sound like.
