Going over some attacks, releases, and Lang

 ### *Lang*
 
 
So basically what I found out when I was tinkering is to use something useful called *Lang*. It's just a little "cheatsheet" with definitions and examples of code you might need in the future.

### Takeaways
====================

- One takeaway I learned was to use cheatsheets to your advantage. I looked forever for something called *.choose*. Googleing like I'm supposed to do with anything I dont know, nothing came up. Until... Lang came

As you can see the lang cheatsheet gives you the correct syntax, definitions, and exampleson whatever you need to know.

### Challenges
====================
I guess a little challenge I faced was tinkering with the examples that were given. When it gave me the example, I typed up the code and it still wasn't working. I looked at everything including lang but still no use. Im still trying to figure it out but I think it's minor.

### Hightlights/Things to know
Tinkering is a major key!
